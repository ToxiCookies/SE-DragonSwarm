This is a Space Engineers Programmable Block script. This script, while being syntactically similar and indeed based off of C#, does not compile anywhere but within the in-game Programmable Block. 
Do not attempt compilation tests or dotnet builds, as these will always fail. 
Ensure self-consistent, efficient, and elegant code above all else.
